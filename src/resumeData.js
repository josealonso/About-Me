  "roleDescription": "I specially like Computer Science subjects when I was in college. I learnt GNU/Linux by myself. I started my career as a C programmer and Linux admin. Later I joint a bootcamp to be a web developer. At work I used Java technologies(Spring Boot, Hibernate), SQL databases, git, AWS, Angular, Material Design components and other tools and frameworks. On 2020 I learnt about the blockchain technology, initially as an investor. I ended up being so amazed by the technological opportunities that I quit my job in March 2021. I have been a full time Solidity and DApp developer since November 2021.",
